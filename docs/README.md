# hashed-permutation

## Synopsis

This is an implementation of Andrew Kensler's hashed permutation, which allows
you to take an array of the elements [0 ... n] and shuffle it, with no memory
overhead and instant access. This works by using a clever hash function to
permute all of the elements in the array.
